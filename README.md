# NC Cinema Star Wars

NC Cinema is a full-stack Django web application that allows users to browse movies, view screening times, and book tickets online. It supports user registration, login/logout, and includes role-based access through Django’s built-in admin panel. This project was developed to demonstrate competency across several full-stack development learning outcomes.

## Design
- The design of NC Cinema focuses on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user experience that aligns with a modern movie-going theme. Key design decisions include:

__Layout and Structure__
- Home Page (Movie List): A clean grid layout displays currently showing movies with titles and posters. Each movie links to a detailed view.

- Movie Detail Page: Provides a dedicated space for movie information with a larger poster, synopsis, duration, release date, and a clearly separated booking section.

- Authentication Pages (Login & Signup): Styled simply and consistently, with centered forms and clear call-to-actions.

- Footer Navigation: Persistent at the bottom of the screen, allowing users to easily log in, sign up, or log out from any page.

__Styling and Aesthetics__
- Background: The site uses a full-page cinema-themed background to immerse users in a moviegoing experience.

- Color Scheme: A dark overlay with golden and light blue highlights was chosen to reflect a cinematic, luxurious vibe.

- Typography: Clean and readable fonts were used, with consistent sizing for headings, body text, and buttons.

__User Experience (UX)__
- Responsive Elements: The layout adapts to screen size and keeps key features (like booking buttons) accessible.

- Feedback: A popup message confirms successful bookings for better interaction.

- Error Handling: User-friendly error messages for login, signup, and form submissions.

- The overall design ensures that the site is easy to navigate, visually consistent, and enhances the user’s experience from browsing movies to booking seats.


## User Experience Flow

__Landing Page__:

- Users see a list of movies with posters and titles.

- They can click on any movie to view more details.

__Detail Page__:

- Users see the selected movie’s info, upcoming screenings, and can book tickets if logged in.

- If not logged in, the site prompts them to log in before booking.

__Authentication__:

- Users can create an account or log in.

- Once authenticated, users can make a booking and view success messages.

__Admin Access__:

- Admins can add/edit/delete movies, screenings, and users through Django’s admin interface.

## Agile Methodologies

- Used Trello and GitHub Issues for tracking features, bugs, and progress

- Project evolved iteratively with priority-based tasks

## Data Modeling

- Models: Movie, Screening, Booking

- Navigation and page links tested across all main pages.

- Registration, login/logout, and user authentication flows verified.

- Admin panel access and content management functions confirmed.

- Image uploads tested via Django Admin and verified on Cloudinary.

- Booking restrictions for authenticated users tested successfully.

- Media and static files served correctly on Heroku deployment.

## Code Validation

- Python code validated with flake8 to ensure PEP8 compliance.

- HTML validated using W3C Markup Validator.

- CSS validated with W3C CSS Validator.

## Deployment

- Project hosted in Gitpod with persistent DB

- GitHub used for version control

## Source Control

- Frequent commits with clear messages

- Used branching where appropriate (e.g. feature/signup-form)
